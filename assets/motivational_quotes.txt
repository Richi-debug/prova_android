The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Well done is better than well said.
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.
The harder you work for something, the greater you'll feel when you achieve it.
Dream bigger. Do bigger.
