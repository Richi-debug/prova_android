# Pomodoro Timer App

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a Pomodoro Timer application using Flutter. The app will help users manage their work and rest intervals based on the Pomodoro Technique.

## Features

*   **Timer Display:** Shows the remaining time for the current work or rest session.
*   **Timer Controls:** Allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer.
*   **Customizable Durations:** Users can set the length of their work and rest periods.
*   **Modern UI:** The app will have a clean and visually appealing design with custom fonts and animations.
*   **State Management:** The app will use a state management solution to handle the timer's state and user settings.
*   **Accessibility:** The app will be designed to be accessible to all users.

## Plan

1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new Flutter project and set up the basic project structure.
2.  **UI Development:**
    *   Create the main screen with the timer display, controls, and settings.
    *   Use the `google_fonts` package for custom fonts.
    *   Add animations to the timer display.
3.  **Timer Logic:**
    *   Implement the timer functionality using the `Timer` class.
    *   Manage the timer's state (work, rest, paused).
    *   Update the UI to reflect the timer's progress.
4.  **State Management:**
    *   Use a state management solution (e.g., `ValueNotifier`) to manage the app's state.
5.  **Testing:**
    *   Write unit tests for the timer logic.
    *   Write widget tests for the UI components.
6.  **Accessibility:**
    *   Ensure the app is accessible to all users.
7.  **Logging:**
    *   Add logging to help with debugging and monitoring.
